# Neural-Networks-and-NLP with PyTorch

### • In this work, I started by reading the documentation of pytorch (http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html# for example)and some articles about Neural Networks and NLP, then I worked on some initiation to Tensors, Back-propagation, Hand-written digit recognition, Language modeling.
### • Then I manipulated some types of Neural Networks like the Convolutional NN applied on MNIST Data (the hello world of Data recognition....the hand digit recognition)
### • Finally, I discovered some NLP: N-Gram Language Modeling and CBOW: Continuous Bag-of-Words.
### • The interpretations are in French Language.
### • This is my personal Work & Interpretations, so it could contains some mistakes. Feel free to Contact me if you find some errors.
