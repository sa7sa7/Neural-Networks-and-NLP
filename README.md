# Neural-Networks-and-NLP

## In this work, I begin with doing some readings, then getting some initiation to Tensors, Back-propagation, Hand-written digit recognition, Language modeling.
## Then I manipulate some types of Neural Networks like the Convolutional NN applied on MNIST Data (the hello world of Data recognition....the hand digit recognition)
## Finally, I discovered some NLP: N-Gram Language Modeling and CBOW: Continuous Bag-of-Words.
## The interpretations are in French Language.
